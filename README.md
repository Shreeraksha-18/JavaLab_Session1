This Java program demonstrates a simple **Library System** using a `Book` class.
It showcases the use of **constructors** and the **`this` keyword** to initialize object data.
Each `Book` object stores details like title, author, and price.
The program prints book details using the `displayDetails()` method.
It helps understand basic **OOP concepts** like classes, objects, and constructors in Java.
